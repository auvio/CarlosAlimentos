I have always been struck by the great diversity, culinarily speaking, of our country.
 
And especially from the north, Asturias as one of the communities where the product that is cooked is spoiled.

We are in the autonomous community that we are, we will find an extensive and varied gastronomic repertoire for any season of the year.
    

But the truth is that despite the great diversity, there are many points in common between many of the classic dessert recipes, which leads me to think that many times we look more than we differentiate ourselves.  

One of the clearest examples may be the traditional Asturian frixuelos typical of these dates.

<p>Preparation of the Asturian frijol cream
In a bowl beat the eggs and add the two tablespoons of sugar. We continue beating until it has been integrated.

Add the tablespoon of cognac, milk, a pinch of salt and the lemon zest. We return to beat to mix the ingredients well.

We add the flour, little by little, while we continue incorporating it with the help of some rods.

We leave the dough at rest for about 30 minutes. This way we get the flour to open, and we have a texture like light cream.
The amount of frixuelos resulting will depend on the size of the pan that we will use. 
I used a small frying pan, about 20 cm. diameter.</p>
    
<p>
Add a drop of oil to the pan and, with a paper towel, spread it over the entire surface of the base.</p>
    
<p>
With a droplet is enough, we just have to cover the surface with a very thin layer.

You do not need a crepe maker, just a normal pan that is non-stick, if it is not, you can not make the frixuelos because they will break when you turn them over.</p>
    
<p>Final preparation of the frixuelos and presentation
When the pan is hot add a portion of the mixture and, tilting the pan make it cover the entire surface of the base of the pan.</p>

<p>
The amount for a small pan is about a little more than half the volume of a cooking ladle.

We leave, at medium high temperature, to make the frixuelo.
When we see that the edges start to peel or toast, we'll turn it around and let it cook 30 or 40 seconds more.
As you go preparing them you will see the point where it is ready very easily, do not worry.
We are placing the frixuelos on a plate and sprinkling it with sugar as we are making them. Placing one on top of another.</p>

<p>
Repeat the operation, wetting the pan with a new drop of oil every time we put you with a new frixuelo.

The traditional way of eating them is by rolling them and it is advisable that they are hot.

With very little work we will have a tray ready to enjoy this great Asturian sweet.
</p>
    
<p>Perfect to serve as breakfast, afternoon snack or dessert at a table accompanied by a rich Asturian liquor, who gives more?
