            <h2 class="h2I">Process:</h2>
            <p>1.- Choose the best raspberries you can find. They should be rinsed well with cold water.<br><br>
               2.- Place the glass jars for preserves, along with the lids and rings in the large pot. Add 5 centimeters of water to the pot, cover, and bring to a boil for 10 minutes.<br><br>
               3.- Place the raspberries in the pot. The volume of sugar you have to add is the same as the volume of the raspberries.<br><br>
               4.- Pour the sugar into the raspberries. Use a strong beater to mix these ingredients. Stir in the corners of the pot to moisten the stagnant sugar there, mix until the juices are extracted so that the whole mixture is moistened.<br><br>
               5.- Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat until the small fat of the liquid rises near the lid of the pot. Pay attention, and do not let the mixture boil.<br><br>
               6.- If the proportion of sugar and raspberries is correct, the mixture stabilizes at approximately 104 Â° C. If the temperature is less, add sugar a tablespoon until you get to the right temperature.<br>Be very careful and pour the boiling mixture into the sterilized jars. Clean the edge of the jars because it is necessary that there is no residue and seal it well.<br><br>
               7.- The foam that is formed is edible, but it is not the most attractive and tasty part. You can remove it with a spoon if you wish. <br> Immediately cover the boiling marmalade with the lid sterilized and secured with a ring.<br><br>
               8.- The next step is to boil the jars in a pot with water. It is not recommended that the jars touch the bottom of the pot, so you must place a grid or other element below them. Add enough water to cover the jars and surpass them by 5 centimeters.<br><br>
               9.- Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil. Then remove the jars from the boiling water. Using pliers for jars is the surest way to do this. When you remove the jars of the bain-marie, place them on the clean towel to cool them down.<br><br>
               10.- Allow the bottles to cool completely for 25 hours in a place that has an air current.<br>And this is all, that's how raspberry jam is made. You can leave this jam on any shelf without excessive heat exposure. Refrigerate it after you open it.</p>
