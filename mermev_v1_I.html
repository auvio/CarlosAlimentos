            <p>1.- The most important thing when making this avocado jam recipe is to choose the main ingredient well. It is hard to go to the store and find ripe avocados, you should know that this fruit is at its point when, when touched, it is neither too hard nor too soft, so we must carefully choose all the pieces.<br><br>
               2.- Likewise, the avocado oxidizes very quickly, so, once we open it, we should take care to cook it quickly to avoid getting bad here. To cut and peel it you have to open it in half, remove the bone and, with the help of a spoon, separate it from the skin.<br><br>
               3.- We must bear in mind that the 500 grams of avocado are needed already cut; This is important because half the weight of the fruit is used in sugar so that the avocado jam fits well. We must unite both ingredients together with the lemon juice and put them in a pot for about three hours to mix well.<br><br>
               4.- After this time, we will put the casserole on the fire and let it simmer for 45 minutes, stirring from time to time. The idea that the mixture does not remain liquid but that it becomes a homogenous mass.<br><br>
               5.- Once we have achieved it, we put out the fire and put the jam in sealed glass containers, in this way we will keep it in good condition for a longer time and be able to consume it a few times.</p>
