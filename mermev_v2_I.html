            <h2 class="h2I">Process:</h2>
            <p>1.- First, peel and wash the onions. We put them in the oven and add a little olive oil on top and a little salt. We cook them in the oven at 200 degrees for about 40 minutes.<br><br>
               2.- When the onions have been roasted, we take them out of the oven. In a saucepan introduce 750 ml of water (three glasses), 500 g of sugar and the chopped onions. We let them simmer for about 30 minutes and stir occasionally so they do not stick in the pan.<br><br>
               3.- When the onions have caramelized and have acquired a darker shade, we extinguish the fire. Now we can pass the jam through the blender so that we have a smoother and more homogeneous texture.<br><br>
               4.- Finally, you have to boil a glass jar in a saucepan to sterilize it and pour the marmalade that we have prepared into it. It is convenient to use some kitchen gloves to avoid burning. Fill the jar until the thread begins. Then we close it and turn it upside down until it cools.<br><br>
               5.- Now you can store this delicious homemade onion jam in a cool, dry and dark place. This will keep it in good condition for about five months. Remember that, once opened, the jar should be stored in the refrigerator or refrigerator so that it is properly stored.<br></p>
