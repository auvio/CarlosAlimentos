            <p>Orange jam is natural and is very soft.</p>

            <ul>
             <li>750 g Oranges, about 3 large oranges with clean skin and no spots.</li>
             <li>600 g of white sugar</li>
             <li>1 lemon (juice of a lemon)</li>

            <h2 class="h2I">Process:</h2>
            <p>1.- We wash and peel the oranges.<br><br>
               2.- We remove all the white part that we have left in the segments of the orange.<br><br>
               3.- With the point of a knife we also remove the white part that has remained on the skin. The more white meat we remove, the less bitter the jam will be. Although if you like bitter orange jam you know, do not remove the white part.<br><br>
               4.- We throw the peeled orange and in segments (removing the seeds if they had), together with the skin and the sugar in the Thermomix. We chop 7 seconds at speed 7.<br><br>
               5.- Open, lower the meat that has remained in the glass with the help of the shovel / spatula. We closed, we programmed 20 minutes, temperature Varona, speed 3.<br><br>
               6.- Add the lemon juice, stir and let warm in the Thermomix glass for a few minutes.<br><br>
               7.- If you like to find pieces, take the jam to a bowl as soon as you finish cooking. On the contrary, if you like more crushed, as on this occasion, let it temper in the glass a few minutes and then grind a few seconds in speed 6.<br><br>
               8.- Take out the marmalade and let it cool completely.</p>
