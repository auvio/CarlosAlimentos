            <table>
                 1 espresso coffee (7-8gr of freshly ground coffee)
            </table>
            <table>
              120 ml of fresh and cold whole milk
            </table>
            <table>
               1 jug of milk of 25cl to make the foam
            </table> <table>
            1 cup cappuccino about 175 ml</table>
                
                <table>1 espresso machine (using purified water)</table>
                <table>1 coffee mill
</table>
                <table>1 tamper (coffee compressor)</table>

       </div>
            
        
            <h2>Prepare the espresso</h2>
            <p class="p1">Choose fresh and high quality coffee beans, grind between 7 and 8 g of coffee in the mill, add the ground coffee to the portafilter of the espresso machine and tamp the ground coffee in the filter holder using a compressor or tamper to make it homogeneous in the cacito. You will wait to make the espresso until the milk has been frothed. The extraction of a good espresso coffee should be between 20-25 seconds.</p>
            
            
            <h2>The foam of milk</h2>
                
            <p>Press the steam button on your espresso machine. Open the steam rod briefly to get rid of residual moisture in the wand. Pour 120 ml of fresh whole milk into a metal milk jug, the level reaches just below the mouthpiece. You have to use fresh whole milk because it makes the best foam.</p>
            
            <h2>Recommendation</h2>
        <p>Put the steam nozzle inside the milk jug until it is just below the surface of the milk and then release the steam.
Listen while you make the milk foam. You should hear a constant sound of ch-ch-ch if you have the wand in the correct position. If you hear a wail is that the steam wand is too much inside the milk jug, raise the tip of the steam rod a bit, but if you see large bubbles, the tip of the steam wand is too high it slightly raises the pitcher.
Up to 38 º C the foam is created, then you only heat the milk. Turn off the steam nozzle when the foam reaches the desired temperature which will be 68 ° C when the steam stops at 68 ° C the temperature will still rise to 70 ° C.
Place the milk jug aside, while making the espresso, you can remove the bubbles by lightly tapping the jug of milk against the table and to keep the foam, keep turning the jar slightly.
</p>
          <h2>Make the Espresso and assemble the Cappuccino</h2>
            
            <p>Place your cup of cappuccino under the espresso dispenser and start the preparation cycle. The first part of the extraction is a dark liquid followed by a rich golden foam called cream. We remind you that the extraction should last between 20 to 25 seconds.
Pour the frothed milk over the espresso coffee and if you have skills do Latte art.
The cappuccino should be about 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk vapor 1/3 milk foam.
