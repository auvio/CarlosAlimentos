            <h2 class="h2I">Process:</h2>
            <p>1.- Preheat the oven to 200ºC with heat up and down.
Peel the heads of garlic without breaking or removing the cloves of garlic. Cut the top part exposing the inside of the tips of the garlic cloves.<br>Wrap the garlic heads in aluminum foil or baking paper and grill in the oven for 45-50 minutes at 200ºC at medium height. You can use it to roast more things (peppers, aubergines, courgettes, etc). They have to be tender to the touch (you can tighten them with kitchen tongs to check it.
Let them cool.<br><br>
               2.- Peel the cloves of garlic. It will be quite easy because with a little squeeze they come out of the skin. Also squeezing out the central nerve, so you can take to remove it from the larger teeth. You will need a cup and ¼ of garlic cloves already peeled.<br><br>
               3.- Boil 1 cup and ½ of water with the sugar. Peel the lemon and pour the skin. Squeeze it and add the juice.<br>Beat with the blender and add ½ cup of water to the garlic cloves until there is a homogeneous, thin and thick cream.<br>When the water is boiling, add the agar and stir well. Then add the mashed roasted garlic and mix well. Wait for it to boil again and put it on medium-low heat. Let it cook and reduce approx. 25 minutes (uncovered), or until it has a creamy appearance. Change it occasionally.<br><br>
               4.- Remove it from the fire, remove the lemon skins and put it in clean jars to store it. If you want a thinner jam, go through a colander.<br>Let it cool and store it in the pantry. If you have opened the cans, store them in the fridge, it will last you up to 2 weeks.<br>Use it for salty dishes, especially tapas, tostas, etc.<br><br>
